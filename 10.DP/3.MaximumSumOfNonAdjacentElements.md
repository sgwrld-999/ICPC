# Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements

## Question

**Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements**

Given an array of integers `arr[]`, find the maximum sum of elements such that no two chosen elements are adjacent in the array.

**Example:**

* Input: `arr = [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]`
* Output: `15`
* Explanation: Choose elements `{3, 10, 7}` → sum = 20 (but 10 and 7 are adjacent, invalid).
  Best choice = `{3, 10}` or `{2, 10}` → sum = 13 or `{3, 5, 7}` → sum = 15.

---

## Approach

There are two standard approaches to solve this problem:

### 1. Recursive + Memoization (Top-Down DP)

* For each index `i`, you have two choices:

  * **Pick current element** → add `arr[i]` and skip the next one (`i+2`).
  * **Skip current element** → move to the next (`i+1`).
* Use recursion + memoization to avoid recomputation.

### 2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)

* Build a DP array `dp[i]` = max sum possible from index `i` to end.
* Iterate backward filling `dp[]`.
* At each step:

  * Pick = `arr[i] + dp[i+2]`
  * NotPick = `dp[i+1]`
  * dp[i] = max(Pick, NotPick).
* Answer = `dp[0]`.

## Pattern

**Dynamic Programming – "Pick / Not Pick" Pattern**

* Hint: *"Whenever a problem asks for maximum/minimum with a restriction on adjacent choices, we think in terms of pick vs not pick decisions."*
* Why DP?

  * Brute force recursion is exponential (each element has two choices).
  * Overlapping subproblems exist → use DP to store results.
  * Either memoization (top-down) or tabulation (bottom-up) can solve efficiently in O(n).

---

## Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (each index processed once).
* **Space Complexity:**

  * Memoization → `O(n)` (stack + dp array).
  * Tabulation → `O(n)` (dp array).
  * Can be optimized to `O(1)` space by storing only last two values.

---

## Dry Run

**Input:** `arr = [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]`

* dp[n-1] = arr[4] = 7
* dp[n-2] = max(arr[3], arr[4]) = max(10, 7) = 10
* i = 2: pick = arr[2] + dp[4] = 5 + 7 = 12, notPick = dp[3] = 10 → dp[2] = 12
* i = 1: pick = arr[1] + dp[3] = 2 + 10 = 12, notPick = dp[2] = 12 → dp[1] = 12
* i = 0: pick = arr[0] + dp[2] = 3 + 12 = 15, notPick = dp[1] = 12 → dp[0] = 15

Answer = dp[0] = 15

## Correct C++ Code

### 1. Recursive + Memoization

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    int helperFun(vector<int>& arr, int n, int idx, vector<int>& dp) {
        if (idx >= n) return 0;  // base case
        if (dp[idx] != -1) return dp[idx];

        // Choice 1: Pick current element and skip next
        int pick = arr[idx] + helperFun(arr, n, idx + 2, dp);

        // Choice 2: Skip current element
        int notPick = helperFun(arr, n, idx + 1, dp);

        return dp[idx] = max(pick, notPick);
    }

public:
    int findMaxSum(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> dp(arr.size(), -1);
        return helperFun(arr, arr.size(), 0, dp);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> arr = {3, 2, 5, 10, 7};
    cout << sol.findMaxSum(arr) << endl; // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxSum(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return arr[0];

        vector<int> dp(n, 0);
        dp[n-1] = arr[n-1];
        dp[n-2] = max(arr[n-2], arr[n-1]);

        for (int i = n-3; i >= 0; i--) {
            int pick = arr[i] + dp[i+2];
            int notPick = dp[i+1];
            dp[i] = max(pick, notPick);
        }

        return dp[0];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> arr = {3, 2, 5, 10, 7};
    cout << sol.findMaxSum(arr) << endl; // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
```
