Of course\! This problem is a great extension of the classic "House Robber." Here are the detailed notes for the "House Robber II" solution.

## **Problem Name:** House Robber II

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)

### **1. Problem Understanding**

This problem is a variation of the original House Robber problem. We are a robber who wants to maximize the loot from a street of houses.

**The Twist:** The houses are arranged in a **circle**. This means the first house and the last house are considered neighbors. As before, we cannot rob two adjacent houses.

**Task:**
Given an array of integers representing the money in each house, find the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

**Example:**

  * `nums = [2, 3, 2]` → `Output: 3`
      * You cannot rob house 0 (value 2) and house 2 (value 2) because they are neighbors in the circle. The best option is to just rob house 1 (value 3).
  * `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]` → `Output: 4`
      * Rob house 0 (1) and house 2 (3) for a total of 4. Or rob house 1 (2) and house 3 (1) for a total of 3. The max is 4.

### **2. When to Think of Dynamic Programming**

The problem's structure points directly to Dynamic Programming:

1.  **Optimization Problem:** The goal is to find the **maximum** amount of money, which is a classic optimization task.
2.  **Making Decisions:** At each house, we have a choice: to rob it or not. The decision we make impacts the choices available for the next houses.
3.  **Reducing to a Simpler Problem:** The core logic of robbing a linear street of houses has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. The main challenge is handling the "circular" constraint.

-----

### **3. The Core Idea: Breaking the Circle**

The only new rule is that **house `0` and house `n-1` cannot be robbed together**. This single constraint is the key. We can't apply the standard "House Robber I" logic directly.

So, how do we handle it? We can break the problem into two separate, simpler scenarios that, when combined, cover all valid possibilities:

1.  **Scenario 1: We DON'T rob the last house.** If we ignore the last house, the problem becomes robbing a simple, linear array of houses from index `0` to `n-2`.
2.  **Scenario 2: We DON'T rob the first house.** If we ignore the first house, the problem becomes robbing a simple, linear array of houses from index `1` to `n-1`.

The true maximum loot will be the **maximum of these two scenarios**. By solving these two linear problems, we elegantly handle the circular dependency. Each of these subproblems is just the original "House Robber I" problem.

### **4. Algorithm (Top-Down with Memoization)**

**Step-by-step:**

1.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If there's only one house, the answer is just the value of that house.
2.  **Create Subproblems:**
      * Create a vector `numsWithFirst` containing all elements from the original `nums` except the last one.
      * Create a vector `numsWithLast` containing all elements from the original `nums` except the first one.
3.  **Solve Subproblems:**
      * Apply the standard "House Robber I" DP logic to `numsWithFirst`.
      * Apply the standard "House Robber I" DP logic to `numsWithLast`.
      * This logic is implemented in the `helperFun`.
4.  **The Helper Function `helperFun(arr, idx)`:**
      * **Base Case:** If `idx` is outside the array bounds, we can't rob anymore, so return `0`.
      * **Memoization:** Check if `dp[idx]` has been solved. If so, return the stored value.
      * **Recurrence Relation:** At index `idx`, we have two choices:
          * **Pick:** Rob house `idx`. The profit is `arr[idx] + helperFun(arr, idx + 2)`.
          * **Not Pick:** Skip house `idx`. The profit is `helperFun(arr, idx + 1)`.
      * Store `max(pick, notPick)` in `dp[idx]` and return it.
5.  **Combine Results:** The final answer is `max(result_from_scenario_1, result_from_scenario_2)`.

### **5. Complexity Analysis**

Let **n** be the number of houses.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
      * We are essentially solving the "House Robber I" problem twice, each on an array of size `n-1`. Since the DP solution for the linear version is $O(n)$, the total time is $O(n-1) + O(n-1) = O(n)$.
  * **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
      * The space is dominated by the DP vectors and the recursion stack depth for our helper function, both of which are proportional to `n`.

### **6. Code**

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    // Standard "House Robber I" logic with memoization
    int helperFun(vector<int>& arr, int n, int idx, vector<int>& dp) {
        // Base case: If we've gone past the houses, profit is 0.
        if (idx >= n) return 0;
        // Memoization: If we already calculated this, return the stored result.
        if (dp[idx] != -1) return dp[idx];

        // Choice 1: Pick the current house and skip the next one.
        int pick = arr[idx] + helperFun(arr, n, idx + 2, dp);
        // Choice 2: Don't pick the current house and move to the next one.
        int notPick = helperFun(arr, n, idx + 1, dp);

        // Store and return the best choice.
        return dp[idx] = max(pick, notPick);
    }

public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) return nums[0]; // Edge case

        // Scenario 1: Rob from houses 0 to n-2 (exclude the last house)
        vector<int> numsWithFirst(nums.begin(), nums.end() - 1);
        vector<int> dp1(numsWithFirst.size() + 1, -1);
        int case1 = helperFun(numsWithFirst, numsWithFirst.size(), 0, dp1);

        // Scenario 2: Rob from houses 1 to n-1 (exclude the first house)
        vector<int> numsWithLast(nums.begin() + 1, nums.end());
        vector<int> dp2(numsWithLast.size() + 1, -1);
        int case2 = helperFun(numsWithLast, numsWithLast.size(), 0, dp2);

        // The answer is the maximum of the two scenarios.
        return max(case1, case2);
    }
};
```

### **7. Key Takeaways**

1.  **Break the Circle:** This problem teaches a powerful technique for handling circular array constraints: convert the circular problem into two or more linear problems that cover all valid cases.
2.  **Reduce and Conquer:** A core problem-solving skill is to recognize when a complex problem can be reduced to a simpler, known problem. Here, "House Robber II" is reduced to two instances of "House Robber I".
3.  **Choice is Key:** The underlying recurrence relation (`pick` vs. `notPick`) is a fundamental pattern in many dynamic programming problems. Mastering it is essential.
