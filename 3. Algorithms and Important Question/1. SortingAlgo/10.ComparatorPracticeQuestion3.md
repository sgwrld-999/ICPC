# Problem statement Explanation

Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest possible number when concatenated. The result should be returned as a string.
Example:

```
nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

# Intuition

* If we only sort numbers in descending order normally, the result might be wrong because `30` will come before `3`, giving `"303"` instead of `"330"`.
* The ordering should depend on **which concatenation of two numbers gives a bigger result**:

  * Compare `"a + b"` with `"b + a"`.
  * If `"a + b"` is greater, `a` should come first.

---

# Approach

1. **Convert numbers to strings** so we can easily concatenate and compare.
2. **Custom sort** using a comparator:

   * For two numbers `a` and `b`:

     * If `a + b` > `b + a`, `a` comes before `b`.
3. After sorting, if the first element is `"0"`, return `"0"` (all numbers are zero).
4. Otherwise, concatenate all strings in sorted order and return.

Example walk-through:

```
nums = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
Step 1: Convert to strings → ["3", "30", "34", "5", "9"]
Step 2: Sort using comparator:
    "9" before "5"
    "5" before "34"
    "34" before "3"
    "3" before "30"
Sorted order → [9, 5, 34, 3, 30]
Step 3: Join → "9534330"
```

# Complexity

* Time complexity:
  **O(n log n)** — due to sorting with a custom comparator.
* Space complexity:
  **O(1)** extra (ignoring string concatenation storage), since sorting is in-place.

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    static bool myComparator(int a, int b){
        string A = to_string(a);
        string B = to_string(b);
        return (A + B) > (B + A);
    }
    string largestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), myComparator);
        
        if(nums[0] == 0) return "0";
        
        string res = "";
        for(auto it : nums){
            res += to_string(it);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

/*
Approach:
    - Convert numbers to strings for easy concatenation and comparison.
    - Compare two numbers by checking which combination produces a bigger value:
        Example:
            nums = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
            "34" + "30" = "3430"
            "30" + "34" = "3034"
            Since "3430" > "3034", 34 should come before 30.
