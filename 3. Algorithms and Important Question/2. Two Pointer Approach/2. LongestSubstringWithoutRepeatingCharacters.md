Got it — here’s the **note-style** explanation in the exact format you like, now with the **Thought Process** and a **Brute Force approach + code** added.

---

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

---

## Thought Process

* Naive idea: check **all substrings** and see which ones have all unique characters → too slow.
* Improve uniqueness check: as we extend a substring, the moment we see a **duplicate**, that substring (from this start) can’t be extended further.
* Even better: instead of restarting from scratch after hitting a duplicate, **slide a window** over `s`:

  * Expand `right` to explore.
  * When a duplicate appears, **shrink from `left`** until the window is valid (all unique).
* Invariant: window `s[left..right]` always contains **unique** characters.

---

## Brute Force Approach

**Idea:** For each start index `i`, extend `j` to the right, use a set to track seen chars. Stop when you hit a duplicate.

**Complexity:**

* Time: `O(n^2)` in worst case (each start extends until first duplicate).
* Space: `O(min(n, charset))`.

### Brute Force Code (O(n^2))

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.size(), maxLen = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            unordered_set<char> seen;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (seen.count(s[j])) break;   // duplicate found, stop extending
                seen.insert(s[j]);
                maxLen = max(maxLen, j - i + 1);
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

## Intuition

We want the longest stretch of characters in `s` where no letter repeats.
Instead of checking every substring (which would be slow), we can use a **sliding window** to keep track of the current substring and expand/contract it as needed.

---

## Approach (Optimized Sliding Window)

1. **Sliding Window with Two Pointers**

   * `left` → start of window
   * `right` → end of window (expands forward)
2. **Tracking Character Frequency**

   * Use an `unordered_map<char, int>` to store counts in the window.
3. **Expand Window**

   * Add `s[right]` to the map.
4. **Shrink Window if Duplicate Found**

   * While `freq[s[right]] > 1`, move `left` forward and decrement counts.
5. **Update Answer**

   * `maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1)`.
6. **Repeat Until `right` Reaches End**

---

## Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` → Each character enters/leaves the window at most once.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(min(n, charset))` → Map size bounded by unique chars in window.

---

## Code (Optimized O(n))

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int left = 0, maxLen = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            freq[s[right]]++;

            // Shrink window until no duplicates
            while (freq[s[right]] > 1) {
                freq[s[left]]--;
                left++;
            }

            // Update max length
            maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

✅ **Key Pattern to Remember:**
For “**longest substring with some property**”, think **sliding window**:

* **Expand** to explore.
* **Shrink** to restore the property.
* **Update** the best length on each valid window.
