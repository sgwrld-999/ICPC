## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Restatement

We are given:

* A list of **burst times** (time each process takes to finish).
* All processes are available at time 0.
* We want the **average waiting time**.

**Waiting time** for a process = time spent **waiting in the queue** before it starts executing.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Key Idea

The **waiting time** for each process is **affected by the jobs before it**.
If you run **short jobs first**, they **finish quickly**, so **more processes get to start earlier** ‚Üí overall waiting time drops.

üìå **Why?**
Imagine you have:

```
Jobs: [10, 2, 3]
Order: [10, 2, 3]
Waiting times: 0, 10, 12 ‚Üí Avg = (0 + 10 + 12)/3 = 7.33
Order: [2, 3, 10]
Waiting times: 0, 2, 5 ‚Üí Avg = (0 + 2 + 5)/3 = 2.33 ‚úÖ MUCH smaller
```

The big job (10) delays **everything** if you put it first.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Intuition

Think of **total waiting time** as the sum of burst times of all jobs **before** each job.

* If you **start with long jobs**, that long duration gets added to the waiting time of many jobs.
* If you **start with short jobs**, you only add a small amount of time to others.

This is **exactly the same** intuition as:

* **Minimizing total completion time** in CPU scheduling.
* **Minimizing total turnaround in greedy algorithms** (like minimizing sum of completion times).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Sorting Works

When all processes are available at time 0, SJF is simply:

1. Sort burst times in **ascending order**.
2. Compute waiting time by accumulating previous jobs‚Äô durations.

This is greedy:

* **Locally optimal choice** (pick shortest next) leads to **globally optimal solution** for average waiting time.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visual Example

```
Burst times = [6, 8, 7, 3]
Sorted      = [3, 6, 7, 8]

Process 1: Wait = 0
Process 2: Wait = 3
Process 3: Wait = 3 + 6 = 9
Process 4: Wait = 3 + 6 + 7 = 16

Total waiting time = 0 + 3 + 9 + 16 = 28
Average waiting time = 28 / 4 = 7
```

If we didn‚Äôt sort, waiting time would be larger.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ When This Works

‚úÖ All processes arrive at the same time.
‚ùå If processes arrive at **different times**, you need a **priority queue** to pick the shortest available job at each moment (Preemptive SJF / Shortest Remaining Time First).

---

## Code + Dry Run

We‚Äôll use the example:

```
Burst times = [6, 8, 7, 3]
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long solve(vector<int>& bt) {
        int n = bt.size();

        // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sort burst times in ascending order
        sort(begin(bt), end(bt));
        // bt = [3, 6, 7, 8]

        int timeEx = 0;   // total execution time elapsed so far
        int waiting = 0;  // total waiting time

        // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate through each process in sorted order
        for (auto it : bt) {
            /*
               Dry run:
               Iteration 1: it = 3
                 waiting += timeEx  ‚Üí waiting = 0 + 0 = 0
                 timeEx  += it      ‚Üí timeEx  = 0 + 3 = 3

               Iteration 2: it = 6
                 waiting += timeEx  ‚Üí waiting = 0 + 3 = 3
                 timeEx  += it      ‚Üí timeEx  = 3 + 6 = 9

               Iteration 3: it = 7
                 waiting += timeEx  ‚Üí waiting = 3 + 9 = 12
                 timeEx  += it      ‚Üí timeEx  = 9 + 7 = 16

               Iteration 4: it = 8
                 waiting += timeEx  ‚Üí waiting = 12 + 16 = 28
                 timeEx  += it      ‚Üí timeEx  = 16 + 8 = 24
            */
            waiting += timeEx;
            timeEx += it;
        }

        // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Return average waiting time
        return waiting / n;  // 28 / 4 = 7
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<int> bt = {6, 8, 7, 3};
    Solution obj;
    cout << obj.solve(bt) << "\n"; // Output: 7
    return 0;
}
```

## How Waiting Time is Calculated

| Process | Burst Time | Time Ex Before | Waiting Added | Total Waiting |
| ------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1       | 3          | 0              | 0             | 0             |
| 2       | 6          | 3              | 3             | 3             |
| 3       | 7          | 9              | 9             | 12            |
| 4       | 8          | 16             | 16            | 28            |

Average waiting time = **28 / 4 = 7**
