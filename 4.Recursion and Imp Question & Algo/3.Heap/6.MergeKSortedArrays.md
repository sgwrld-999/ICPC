## **Problem Name:** Merge K Sorted Arrays

### **Problem Statement**

Given `k` sorted arrays, each of size `k`, merge them into a single sorted array of size `k*k`.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
k = 3
arr = [[1, 3, 5],
       [2, 4, 6],
       [0, 9, 10]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]
```

### **Intuition / Approach**

* Since all arrays are already sorted, we need a way to merge them efficiently.
* **Naive approach:** Merge all arrays into one big array and sort → `O(k^2 log k^2)`
* **Better approach:** Use a **min-heap** to get the smallest element among all arrays efficiently.
* Each time, push all elements into a **min-heap**, then pop one by one to form the merged array.

**Why Min-Heap?**

* Min-heap always gives the **smallest element** in `O(log n)`, which is perfect to maintain the sorted order while merging multiple arrays.

---

### **Step-by-Step Approach**

1. Initialize a **min-heap**.
2. Push all elements from all `k` arrays into the heap.
3. Pop elements from the heap one by one and append to the answer array.
4. Return the merged sorted array.

### **Dry Run Example**

Input:

```
k = 3
arr = [[1, 3, 5],
       [2, 4, 6],
       [0, 9, 10]]
```

1. **Push all elements into min-heap:** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`

   * Heap automatically arranges in min order.
2. **Pop elements one by one to form result array:**

   * Pop 0 → result = `[0]`
   * Pop 1 → result = `[0, 1]`
   * Pop 2 → result = `[0, 1, 2]`
   * Pop 3 → result = `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
   * Pop 4 → result = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   * Pop 5 → result = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   * Pop 6 → result = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   * Pop 9 → result = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`
   * Pop 10 → result = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`

**Final merged array:** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`

### **Time Complexity**

* Pushing all elements → `O(k^2 log k^2)`
* Popping all elements → `O(k^2 log k^2)`
* **Total:** `O(k^2 log k^2)`

---

### **Space Complexity**

* Heap stores all `k*k` elements → `O(k^2)`

---

### **Code**

```cpp
class Solution
{
    public:
    vector<int> mergeKArrays(vector<vector<int>> arr, int K)
    {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        
        // Push all elements into the min-heap
        for(auto vec : arr){
            for(auto it : vec){
                pq.push(it);
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> ans;
        
        // Pop elements to form sorted array
        while(!pq.empty()){
            ans.push_back(pq.top());
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

✅ **Key Takeaways**

* Min-heap is useful to merge multiple sorted arrays efficiently.
* Always push the smallest elements first to maintain the sorted order.
* For `k` sorted arrays of size `k`, this method works well for moderate `k`.
