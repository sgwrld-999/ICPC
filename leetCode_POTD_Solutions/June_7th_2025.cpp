/*
 üí≠ Thought Process:
 The problem requires that every time we encounter a '*', we must remove (i.e., eliminate) the lexicographically smallest character to the left of that star.
 This implies that for every '*', we need to search for the smallest character among all characters before it ‚Äî and this needs to be done repeatedly, potentially many times.

 ‚úÖ Possible Solutions:
 1. Brute Force Approach:
 For every '*' encountered:

 Scan all characters to its left (that haven‚Äôt been removed).

 Find the smallest character and its index.

 Mark it as removed (e.g., replace it with '*' or use a boolean array).

 Time Complexity: O(n¬≤) in the worst case, especially if many '*' characters appear.

 Drawback: Inefficient for large strings with many stars, as it rescans repeatedly.

 2. Optimized Approach with Data Structure:
 Use a priority queue (min-heap) or balanced BST to always keep track of the smallest valid characters (along with their indices).

 For each character:

 If it's not a '*', insert it into the structure.

 If it is a '*', remove the smallest character seen so far and mark it.

 Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to insertions and deletions in the heap.

 Trade-off: Slightly more complex logic, but scales better.

 üìù Interview Tip:
 Mention that although a stack works for a "last in, first out" character removal (like backspace logic), here we need to remove the smallest character, not the last ‚Äî hence a priority queue or custom data structure is more suitable.
