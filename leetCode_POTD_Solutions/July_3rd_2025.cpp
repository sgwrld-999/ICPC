/*
Thought process:

- We start with the string "a".
- In every step, we append the successor of each character in the string:
  "a" -> "ab", because successor of 'a' is 'b'
  "ab" -> "abbc", because successors are 'b' and 'c'
  So the string becomes: a -> ab -> abbc -> abbcbccd -> ...
- We continue this process until the string length becomes â‰¥ k.
- Then we simply return the (k-1)th character.

Fixes:
- `s[i]` was incorrect; it should be `word[i]`.
- Efficient handling of successor: if 'z', then wrap to 'a', else add 1 to the character.
