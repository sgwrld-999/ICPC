/**
 * Thought Process:
 * ----------------
 * 1. **Problem Understanding**: 
 *    - Find any peak element in an array (element greater than its neighbors)
 *    - Peak element: arr[i] > arr[i-1] && arr[i] > arr[i+1]
 *    - Array boundaries are considered as negative infinity
 *    - At least one peak is guaranteed to exist
 * 
 * 2. **Key Insight**: 
 *    - Think of array as a mountain range - there's always at least one peak
 *    - If we're on an ascending slope (arr[mid] < arr[mid+1]), peak must be ahead
 *    - If we're on a descending slope (arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]), peak must be behind
 *    - We can eliminate half the array at each step using this property
 * 
 * 3. **Why Binary Search Works**:
 *    - Unlike standard binary search, we don't need the array to be sorted
 *    - We use the slope direction to decide which half contains a peak
 *    - Since boundaries are -âˆž, we're guaranteed to find a peak
 * 
 * 4. **Approach**:
 *    - Handle edge cases: single element, first/last element peaks
 *    - Use binary search on middle elements (indices 1 to n-2)
 *    - If arr[mid] > arr[mid-1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]: found peak
 *    - If arr[mid] < arr[mid+1]: ascending slope, search right half
 *    - Else: descending slope, search left half
 * 
 * 5. **Edge Cases**:
 *    - Single element: always a peak
 *    - First element > second element: first is peak
 *    - Last element > second last element: last is peak
 *    - All elements same: any element is peak
 * 
 * 6. **Complexity**:
 *    - Time: O(log n) - binary search
 *    - Space: O(1) - constant extra space
