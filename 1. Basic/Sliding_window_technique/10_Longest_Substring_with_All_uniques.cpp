/*
Thinking or thought process:

1. As per the question (ATQ), we need to find the maximum length of a sub-array (or substring) with all unique characters.
   So, we'll use a variable to track the maximum length (`maxLen`).

2. To ensure that all characters in the current window are unique, we must keep track of character frequencies.
   For this, we use a frequency map â€” hence, the choice of an unordered_map (hashmap).

The key point to note here is that no fixed window size `k` is given. 
So, we dynamically adjust the window. A valid window must have:
    - The number of unique characters (`freq.size()`)
    - Equal to the window size (`right - left + 1`)

For example:
    Input: "aasvs"
    - In the window "asv", all characters are unique.
    - Each character appears once, so `freq.size() == windowSize`.
    - This is a valid candidate for the longest substring.
